I think we people are really complex material. But since I guess it's good I say a bit, I would define myself as someone fascinated about living and getting to know both this planet and its inhabitants. I'm interested in serving people, especially, but not exclusively, my friends. I enjoy good food and if possible better company. My interests are broad and go from traveling, literature, creative writing, philosophy and body ""care"" to Buddhism.  I'm pushful, curious, a bit narcissist maybe, hahaha, and I guess I tend to dream pies in the sky far too often.

I am original Catalan, from lovely Girona - Costa Brava but I've lived abroad for many long periods: Miami, Dubai, Bali and Melbourne (Australia). My live partner is a lovely aussie-greek Personal Trainer named Stelios and, together we travel the world, when not working.

I like outdoors sports and I am addicted to mountain biking. I also like snowboarding, climbing, hiking, swimming ...; I also do some mat work like yoga and Pilates (of which I am a certified Instructor). 

I read a lot, books facinate me!!

I like to go out eating with my friends from time to time, although I am most of a day-creature and at night I like my sleep. I practice ioga and meditation and have a second level on Reiki. I'm a flexitarian (meaning I eat fish but not meat) by moral reasons and I enjoy a lot good food, if possible made with organic products. Music, all kind of music - depending on the moment - is very important to me; couldn't live without it. But my main and huge passion is travelling and meeting new people, travellers like me, or locals, and learn about them and their experiences in life. 

After many yearts working for others, I am now running my my own company. It's a fresh project dedicated to giving marketing and creativity services & solutions to other companies. I am also a teacher at the University of Girona, where I teach at the Faculties of Tourism and Economics and I run an international women's project named ""Grace of No Age"", devoted to mature women.

I am pretty busy however I don't complain, as I do what I like.",within an hour,t,https://a0.muscache.com/im/pictures/user/fbea53e8-bfc4-4620-9a4c-c8b47784a2ca.jpg?aki_policy=profile_small,https://a0.muscache.com/im/pictures/user/fbea53e8-bfc4-4620-9a4c-c8b47784a2ca.jpg?aki_policy=profile_x_medium,--,"['email', 'phone', 'work_email']",t,t,"Girona, CT, Spain",Girona,--,Private room in condo,Private room,0.0,1 private bath,1.0,"[""Shared pool"", ""Refrigerator"", ""Long term stays allowed"", ""Shampoo"", ""Microwave"", ""Host greets you"", ""First aid kit"", ""Elevator"", ""Free street parking"", ""Hangers"", ""Dishes and silverware"", ""Heating"", ""Cooking basics"", ""Outdoor furniture"", ""Private backyard – Fully fenced"", ""TV"", ""Shared patio or balcony"", ""Washer"", ""Hot water"", ""Indoor fireplace"", ""Hair dryer"", ""Kitchen"", ""Iron"", ""Dishwasher"", ""Dryer"", ""Single level home"", ""Coffee maker"", ""Essentials"", ""Wifi"", ""Fire extinguisher""]",--,t,31/03/2023,08/10/2010,27/02/2023,HUTG-049542,f

If you are looking for a destination with pearly white beaches, azure blue sea, incredibly beautiful nature and culture and lots of fun? Tulum has it all. This ancient Maya city is just a bit further south than the famous Playa del Carmen in the province of Quitana Roo (next to Yucatan) in Mexico. 
A destination that you absolutely should not miss when you are traveling in the Riviera Maya

Tulum's most well-known attractions are its ruins, cenotes & water sports, (Snorkelling and Diving). We warmly welcome you to enjoy and discover this beautiful region and immerse yourself in the relaxed atmosphere of Tulum ....

Let's start: I was born in a small town in l'EmpordÃ , called Torroella de MontgrÃ­. Those were also a mixture of happy and wild times, a bit like Amarcord from Fellini (watch it if you haven't).
Then I studied computer science in Barcelona, and a PhD with a part of it in London, about medical imaging.
In between something entered my life, for good: yoga: I started practicing and soon I was so pationated then when I finished my PhD it was obvious that becoming a teaching would be the best choice of my life.
So I practice yoga every day, and also: I love music, and I play myself the accordeon and the clarinet. Just as an amateur, but the pleasure of making music is amazing. I also like dancing, folk music and lately also Lindy Hop (Girona has a few places to dance if you are into it).
I like eating well and healthy. Not to much meat (I am sorry for those creatures we kill but sometimes it comes and I eat).
I like travelling, in all wild ways, but I am not a traveller that can tell thousands things! I participate as well in the couchsurfing project, from time to time- and when there isn't already someone at my place, a friend or a friend of a friend.
The apartment I rent, Girona Riverside, was planned to be for me as another floor was ment to be the yoga studio. However now I have another, bigger, place for yoga and I rent it. I hope you like it!
As a buddhist (if I can call myself that which I don't know) my motto would be to understand the sources of suffering, and enjoy immediate happyness.

We live in Mas Can Banal for many years. Stendert, born '51, originally is from Breda-Holland, and Maria, born '66, is from Stockholm-Sweden, where her parents once had arrived from Spain. We enjoy very much living here in the countryside surrounded by hills, forests, and rivers. Halfway to the sea and to the high mountains.

We are accompanied by our daughter Saskia born '02 and Stendert's son - Luuk, born  '93, who works in our village and in their spare time help us.

Our professions are of the most diverse; Maria studied interior design and artistic glass techniques and Stendert studied to become a tropical agronomist and later carpentry. Probably this multifaceted mixture connects us with many diverse interests and activities, especially the maintenance of CB with its forest, animals, and agro-tourism.

We hope to be able to combine these aspects of us and make your stay as pleasant and memorable as possible. Together, we speak 7 European languages and understand a few more.

Una masÃ­a del siglo XV, restaurada con un estilo muy personal, y rodeada de campos, bosques y caminos que llegan hasta un rÃ­o que merece ser escuchado al menos durante un rato. Su propietario, Miguel, se ha encargado de darle su propia personalidad a la casa durante siete aÃ±os, creando diferentes rincones en los que puedes charlar con tu pareja disfrutando de una buena botella de vino mientras tus hijos juegan libremente por los alrededores, compartir con otros huÃ©spedes costumbres y (Website hidden by Airbnb) de tus mascotas mientras ves cÃ³mo ellas disfrutan y se persiguen felices, o subir a la planta de arriba y escoger una de esas pelÃ­culas que tenÃ­as pendiente para hacerte un homenaje frente a una gran pantalla. Puedes hacer lo que quieras, porque en Mas Torrencito la libertad se respira a cada momento y en cada lugar.

Marcos, Manuela y MatÃ­as, tres de las mascotas de Miguel, son el autÃ©ntico espÃ­ritu de la casa. Esos tres perros deberÃ­an tener contrato indefinido y pensiÃ³n vitalicia. Ellos muestran la casa a los nuevos huÃ©spedes, sus 8 confortables habitaciones dobles y triples, los baÃ±os completos, el salÃ³n de techos altos y vigas de madera, el antiguo horno de pan, la sala de entretenimientos, la piscina y el jardÃ­n con mobiliario y juegos para niÃ±os. Pero tambiÃ©n acompaÃ±an a los huÃ©spedes durante los paseos, entretienen a mayores y niÃ±os con su buen carÃ¡cter y sus ganas de jugar, y relacionan con las mascotas reciÃ©n llegadas con paciencia, cariÃ±o y una gran amabilidad.

Mientras tanto, Miguel cocina. Y cÃ³mo cocina. Platos elaborados con productos de su propia huerta. Recetas que le chivan las madres de los propietarios de los restaurantes de los alrededores. Bizcochos con diferentes sabores, mermeladas, cereales, pan reciÃ©n hecho y embutidos de la zona, una de las mejores del paÃ­s en esta especialidad.

My name is Javier, and although I'm originally from Girona, I've been living in Barcelona for the past 25 years, so I know the city and its surroundings quite well.
 
Traveling is one of my favourites hobbies. I love getting to know different cultures and people from around the world. I had the chance to visit many countries, either for fun or for professional reasons, since my last job was as a publisher for trade magazines.
 
I started the business of rental apartments âThe Vintage Rentalsâ  because as a tourist, I lived first hand the benefits of living a local experience wherever I go, and I know other people search the same type of authentic vacations. This is how I got into the this business and now I have apartments in the best areas of Barcelona with all the necessary facilities for an affordable price.
 
I invite you to come and discover a different and unique experience of Barcelona and all its beautiful locations and sites!

We live in Mas Can Banal for many years. Stendert, born '51, originally is from Breda-Holland, and Maria, born '66, is from Stockholm-Sweden, where her parents once had arrived from Spain. We enjoy very much living here in the countryside surrounded by hills, forests, and rivers. Halfway to the sea and to the high mountains.

We are accompanied by our daughter Saskia born '02 and Stendert's son - Luuk, born  '93, who works in our village and in their spare time help us.

Our professions are of the most diverse; Maria studied interior design and artistic glass techniques and Stendert studied to become a tropical agronomist and later carpentry. Probably this multifaceted mixture connects us with many diverse interests and activities, especially the maintenance of CB with its forest, animals, and agro-tourism.

We hope to be able to combine these aspects of us and make your stay as pleasant and memorable as possible. Together, we speak 7 European languages and understand a few more. We like very much to tell you about our favorite places, help you out for more personal advice and add if there is a special event going on.

Nos acompaÃ±a nuestra hija Saskia, nacida '02 y Luuk, hijo de Stendert,  nacido en el '93, que trabaja en nuestro pueblo. Ambos en sus ratos libres nos ayudan en diferentes tareas.

Nuestras profesiones son de la mÃ¡s diversa; MarÃ­a estudiÃ³ diseÃ±o de interiores y tÃ©cnicas de vidrio artÃ­stico y Stendert estudiÃ³ para ser ingeniero agrÃ³nomo tropical y mas tarde carpinterÃ­a. Probablemente esta mezcla multifacÃ©tica , nos conecta con muchos diversos intereses y actividades, en especial el mantenimiento de CB con su bosque, los animales y el agroturismo.

Esperamos ser capaces de combinar estos aspectos de nosotros y como hacer que su estancia sea lo mÃ¡s agradable y memorable como sea posible.

My name is Amalia, I am English/Canadian and my husband Dani is Russian. We met here on the Costa Brava, have lived here for almost 15 years. We speak EspanglishRuss together!

I work from home whereas Dani manages a super yacht in Barcelona and is often out 'at sea'. We both enjoy travelling and finding adventure when we can doing outdoorsy stuff like motorbiking or cycling; on-and-off road, horse riding and long dog hikes, but more often than not we're both working or relaxing in the garden at home. Well, to be honest, usually Dani is doing the gardening whilst I practise juggling, hula hoop, poi - or whatever is the latest skill I'm learning off YouTube!
 I'm a passionate animal lover and have 2 dogs, 8 cats and 1 horse. When I'm relaxing I love to just hang out with my animals and read a book. Guests have full access to my large library of books. Quite a few are beach-read best sellers - perfect for holidaymakers.

As we are often out-and-about our good friend Amber Jane will help you with  enquiries and bookings in the first instance and I will meet you when you arrive at Space Oasis Holiday Villa.

We live in Mas Can Banal for many years. Stendert, born '51, originally is from Breda-Holland, and Maria, born '66, is from Stockholm-Sweden, where her parents once had arrived from Spain. We enjoy very much living here in the countryside surrounded by hills, forests, and rivers. Halfway to the sea and to the high mountains.

We are accompanied by our daughter Saskia born '02 and Stendert's son - Luuk, born  '93, who works in our village and in their spare time help us.

Our professions are of the most diverse; Maria studied interior design and artistic glass techniques and Stendert studied to become a tropical agronomist and later carpentry. Probably this multifaceted mixture connects us with many diverse interests and activities, especially the maintenance of CB with its forest, animals, and agro-tourism.

We hope to be able to combine these aspects of us and make your stay as pleasant and memorable as possible. Together, we speak 7 European languages and understand a few more. We like very much to tell you about our favorite places, help you out for more personal advice and add if there is a special event going on.

When my father passed away, my husband and I decided to fulfill his dream and complete the restoration... now our historic masia has been turned into a charming luxury villa & spa.

We live in Mas Can Banal for many years. Stendert, born '51, originally is from Breda-Holland, and Maria, born '66, is from Stockholm-Sweden, where her parents once had arrived from Spain. We enjoy very much living here in the countryside surrounded by hills, forests, and rivers. Halfway to the sea and to the high mountains.

We are accompanied by our daughter Saskia born '02 and Stendert's son - Luuk, born  '93, who works in our village and in their spare time help us.

Our professions are of the most diverse; Maria studied interior design and artistic glass techniques and Stendert studied to become a tropical agronomist and later carpentry. Probably this multifaceted mixture connects us with many diverse interests and activities, especially the maintenance of CB with its forest, animals, and agro-tourism.

We hope to be able to combine these aspects of us and make your stay as pleasant and memorable as possible. Together, we speak 7 European languages and understand a few more. We like very much to tell you about our favorite places, help you out for more personal advice and add if there is a special event going on.

Nos acompaÃ±a nuestra hija Saskia, nacida '02 y Luuk, hijo de Stendert,  nacido en el '93, que trabaja en nuestro pueblo. Ambos en sus ratos libres nos ayudan en diferentes tareas.

Nuestras profesiones son de la mÃ¡s diversa; MarÃ­a estudiÃ³ diseÃ±o de interiores y tÃ©cnicas de vidrio artÃ­stico y Stendert estudiÃ³ para ser ingeniero agrÃ³nomo tropical y mas tarde carpinterÃ­a.

Mas Torrencito es una casa rural diferente. Una masÃ­a del siglo XV, restaurada con un estilo muy personal, y rodeada de campos, bosques y caminos que llegan hasta un rÃ­o que merece ser escuchado al menos durante un rato. Su propietario, Miguel, se ha encargado de darle su propia personalidad a la casa durante siete aÃ±os, creando diferentes rincones en los que puedes charlar con tu pareja disfrutando de una buena botella de vino mientras tus hijos juegan libremente por los alrededores, compartir con otros huÃ©spedes costumbres y (Website hidden by Airbnb) de tus mascotas mientras ves cÃ³mo ellas disfrutan y se persiguen felices, o subir a la planta de arriba y escoger una de esas pelÃ­culas que tenÃ­as pendiente para hacerte un homenaje frente a una gran pantalla. Puedes hacer lo que quieras, porque en Mas Torrencito la libertad se respira a cada momento y en cada lugar.

Marcos, Manuela y MatÃ­as, tres de las mascotas de Miguel, son el autÃ©ntico espÃ­ritu de la casa. Esos tres perros deberÃ­an tener contrato indefinido y pensiÃ³n vitalicia. Ellos muestran la casa a los nuevos huÃ©spedes, sus 8 confortables habitaciones dobles y triples, los baÃ±os completos, el salÃ³n de techos altos y vigas de madera, el antiguo horno de pan, la sala de entretenimientos, la piscina y el jardÃ­n con mobiliario y juegos para niÃ±os. Pero tambiÃ©n acompaÃ±an a los huÃ©spedes durante los paseos, entretienen a mayores y niÃ±os con su buen carÃ¡cter y sus ganas de jugar, y relacionan con las mascotas reciÃ©n llegadas con paciencia, cariÃ±o y una gran amabilidad.

Mientras tanto, Miguel cocina. Y cÃ³mo cocina. Platos elaborados con productos de su propia huerta. Recetas que le chivan las madres de los propietarios de los restaurantes de los alrededores. Bizcochos con diferentes sabores, mermeladas, cereales, pan reciÃ©n hecho y embutidos de la zona, una de las mejores del paÃ­s en esta especialidad.

Mas Torrencito se puede disfrutar en pareja si te gustan los animales, ya que es una manera de poder disfrutar de su compaÃ±Ã­a siempre que quieras. TambiÃ©n es un lugar ideal para niÃ±os, ya que rÃ¡pidamente se enamorarÃ¡n de Marcos, Matias y Manuela, probablemente la mejor buscadora de piedras del mundo. Y tambiÃ©n es un lugar perfecto para visitar con tu propia mascota, disfrutar de unos dÃ­as en la naturaleza y que los dos hagÃ¡is buenos amigos. En Mas Torrencito te sientes parte de algo, y cada visita es diferente a las demÃ¡s.

We travel a lot - New York, Sydney, Europe, Asia - and over the years we have come to places where we have found special details or fantastic ambience or great views. These ""moments"" have been the inspiration for Villa Mariposa. Spacious, not to much furniture, a garden garden that tells a story over the year - and a view that takes the breath away.",within an hour,f,https://a0.muscache.com/im/users/15184194/profile_pic/1399897570/original.jpg?aki_policy=profile_small,https://a0.muscache.com/im/users/15184194/profile_pic/1399897570/original.jpg?aki_policy=profile_x_medium,--,"['email', 'phone']",t,t,"Calonge, Catalonia, Spain",Calonge,--,Entire villa,Entire home/apt,0.0,2.5 baths,4.0,"[""Balay induction stove"", ""32"" TV"", ""Valley view"", ""Outdoor shower"", ""Baking sheet"", ""Microwave"", ""Host greets you"", ""First aid kit"", ""Private entrance"", ""Garden view"", ""Free street parking"", ""Hangers"", ""Blender"", ""Room-darkening shades"", ""Dishes and silverware"", ""Bed linens"", ""Bay view"", ""Toaster"", ""Cooking basics"", ""Smoke alarm"", ""Public or shared beach access"", ""Outdoor furniture"", ""Private patio or balcony"", ""Private outdoor pool - available all year, open 24 hours"", ""Washer"", ""Portable fans"", ""Balay refrigerator"", ""Drying rack for clothing"", ""Clothing storage"", ""Cleaning products"", ""Pool view"", ""Ocean view"", ""Hot water"", ""Sun loungers"", ""Hair dryer"", ""Kitchen"", ""Iron"", ""Freezer"", ""Dishwasher"", ""Wine glasses"", ""Coffee maker: french press, Nespresso"", ""Barbecue utensils"", ""Dining table"", ""Outdoor dining area"", ""Hot water kettle"", ""Balay oven"", ""Security cameras on property"", ""Essentials"", ""Ceiling fan"", ""Wifi"", ""Fire extinguisher""]",--,t,01/04/2023,10/08/2014,17/09/2022,HUTG-014865,f

Vivo en La Bisbal d'EmpordÃ , con Silvia, mi compaÃ±era y con Mel, Maui y Bruno, nuestras mascotas.

Me licenciÃ© en Derecho en el aÃ±o 2000 pero nunca he ejercido la profesiÃ³n; seguramente, porquÃ© prefiero la tranquilidad de la vida en mi tierra que teÃ±ir mi existencia con las tensiones de los Tribunales ( no estoy hecho para esto ).

En Airbnb anunciamos casas de la familia ( 2 casas en Canet de La Tallada y dos apartamentos en Palau-Sator ) y tambiÃ©n otra casa cuyos derechos de explotaciÃ³n he adquirido ( Sant Iscle d'EmpordÃ  ).

El proyecto inicial de las casas de Canet de la Tallada era la venta pero la depresiÃ³n del sector inmobiliario hizo a la familia cambiar de opiniÃ³n y decidimos su explotaciÃ³n en modo de arrendamiento. AdemÃ¡s, cuando no estÃ¡n alquiladas las usamos la familia ( somos 5 hermanos ).

En Palau-Sator, los apartamentos que tienen origen en la rehabilitaciÃ³n de la casa de mis abuelos paternos. Era una casa muy grande y hace ya mÃ¡s de 15 aÃ±os la familia tomÃ³ la decisiÃ³n de restaurara en este sentido.

DespuÃ©s de 3 aÃ±os en la plataforma, mi experiencia como anfitriÃ³n con Airbnb es francamente buena. Salvo pequeÃ±os detalles y algÃºn caso aislado estamos muy contentos con los huÃ©spedes que nos han llegado.

Recomiendo el EmpordÃ  de forma enÃ©rgica, cualquiera de sus rincones, espacios, paisajes o playas...Esta regiÃ³n, es muchÃ­simo mÃ¡s que el conocido TriÃ¡ngulo de Oro. Os lo aseguro!! 

AquÃ­, puedes relajarte, divertirte, ir de fiesta, en globo, practicar equitaciÃ³n, bajar en canoa por el rÃ­o Ter, alquilar un velero, ir en bici, jugar a Golf o Picht&Putt, practicar nudismo, baÃ±arte en calas preciosas o, si lo prefieres, en playas kilomÃ©tricas, perderte en largos paseos al atarceder y comerte un buen arroz!!

Fue en Mayo del 2013 que decidimos venir a vivir aquÃ­ en la provincia de Girona ... y hacer un cambio radical de vida. NecesitÃ¡bamos alejarnos de la ciudad, de la falta de respeto, de una convivencia que se hacÃ­a cada vez mÃ¡s insoportable, del egoÃ­smo y anonimato que conocÃ­amos en Barcelona. Ahora disfrutamos de estos pequeÃ±os detalles de cada dÃ­a, en Llampaies, un nÃºcleo de muy pocos habitantes: el cielo, sus amaneceres y puestas de sol, el ambiente rural al 100%. la naturaleza con nuestros insectos, plantas y Ã¡rboles, nuestros animales con las gallinas y conejos, nuestro gato Llamp y sobre todo disfrutar cada momento con nuestros hijos, Roger y Oriol.

Vivo en La Bisbal d'EmpordÃ , con Silvia, mi compaÃ±era y con Mel, Maui y Bruno, nuestras mascotas.

Me licenciÃ© en Derecho en el aÃ±o 2000 pero nunca he ejercido la profesiÃ³n; seguramente, porquÃ© prefiero la tranquilidad de la vida en mi tierra que teÃ±ir mi existencia con las tensiones de los Tribunales ( no estoy hecho para esto ).

En Airbnb anunciamos casas de la familia ( 2 casas en Canet de La Tallada y dos apartamentos en Palau-Sator ) y tambiÃ©n otra casa cuyos derechos de explotaciÃ³n he adquirido ( Sant Iscle d'EmpordÃ  ).

El proyecto inicial de las casas de Canet de la Tallada era la venta pero la depresiÃ³n del sector inmobiliario hizo a la familia cambiar de opiniÃ³n y decidimos su explotaciÃ³n en modo de arrendamiento. AdemÃ¡s, cuando no estÃ¡n alquiladas las usamos la familia ( somos 5 hermanos ).

En Palau-Sator, los apartamentos que tienen origen en la rehabilitaciÃ³n de la casa de mis abuelos paternos. Era una casa muy grande y hace ya mÃ¡s de 15 aÃ±os la familia tomÃ³ la decisiÃ³n de restaurara en este sentido.

DespuÃ©s de 3 aÃ±os en la plataforma, mi experiencia como anfitriÃ³n con Airbnb es francamente buena. Salvo pequeÃ±os detalles y algÃºn caso aislado estamos muy contentos con los huÃ©spedes que nos han llegado.

Recomiendo el EmpordÃ  de forma enÃ©rgica, cualquiera de sus rincones, espacios, paisajes o playas...Esta regiÃ³n, es muchÃ­simo mÃ¡s que el conocido TriÃ¡ngulo de Oro. Os lo aseguro!! 

AquÃ­, puedes relajarte, divertirte, ir de fiesta, en globo, practicar equitaciÃ³n, bajar en canoa por el rÃ­o Ter, alquilar un velero, ir en bici, jugar a Golf o Picht&Putt, practicar nudismo, baÃ±arte en calas preciosas o, si lo prefieres, en playas kilomÃ©tricas, perderte en largos paseos al atarceder y comerte un buen arroz!!

We restored first the old farmhouse dated 1870 and this is the place we used to live in ourselves. Now this beautiful  farmhouse is also for rent and we named it La Ferme.  We ourselves moved to ChÃ¢teau Preyssac in Thenon,  which we are renovating right now.  We started to restore all the other buildings on the domaine. Many years later we could buy the land of our neighbors and we were able to completely renovate the Maison de Maitre and opening it for guests six years ago. 
We are originally from the Netherlands, however 16 years ago we moved from Holland to the United Arab Emirates with our daughter Sanne. 
Nowadays I spend my time between France and the Emirates and together with my daughter Sanne and a dedicated team we take care of our guests in France and Spain, where we also have a family property ( las Rocas) hosted by my cousin Gijb.
Apart from las Rocas we now manage 3 more properties in Rosas: 
Belleza del Mar, Casa Diaz, and Casa Flamenco. 
in the future we hope to add some more treehouses at the domaine Lalande-Laborie. At the moment there are two and maybe in the future in the forests of Preyssac !!

SÃ³c Marc LÃ³pez, de Palafrugell, perÃ² actualment resident a Girona. 
SÃ³c compositor, i treballo de professor de mÃºsica en un institut de secundÃ ria i de professor d'harmonia i guitarra a escoles de mÃºsica. M'agrada molt practicar esport i tota mena d'activitats a l'aire lliure, cosa que vaig fent en funciÃ³ del temps lliure del que disposo. 
Conec molt bÃ© Palafrugell. Ãs el poble on he crescut i on he viscut tota la meva infantesa i adolescÃ¨ncia. Tinc meravellosos records dels estius d'aquella Ã¨poca: les anades i vingudes diÃ ries a les platges de Calella, la sal i la flaire del mar sobre la pell bronzejada pel sol, els vespres de Festa Major a PlaÃ§a Nova... No hi ha res com passar l'estiu en un poble de la costa mediterrÃ nia com Palafrugell. De fet, malgrat tenir la residÃ¨ncia habitual a Girona, cada any hi torno a l'estiu i intento passar-hi tant temps com sigui possible. AixÃ² em permet reviure totes aquelles meravelloses sensacions vitals!  
MÃ©s que no pas un allotjament en sÃ­ mateix, aquestes sensacions sÃ³n l'essÃ¨ncia del que Airbnb em permet compartir amb tots vosaltres. L'apartament, si bÃ© Ã©s molt  important, nomÃ©s Ã©s el mitjÃ  que ha de fer possible que els hostes vingueu fins aquÃ­ i conegueu el poble i els paratges Ãºnics que hi ha a les rodalies. PerÃ² la finalitat, allÃ² que Ã©s realment important aconseguir, Ã©s gaudir de les vivÃ¨ncies i sensacions Ãºniques que, com jo, tindreu el plaer i el privilegi d'experimentar passant l'estiu en un poble de la costa catalana com aquest.
Per mi serÃ  tot un plaer ser el vostre cicerone, compartir aquestes experiÃ¨ncies i guiar-vos a travÃ©s de tot aquest tresor de sensacions mediterrÃ nies. Benvinguts a l'estiu! Benvinguts a Palafrugell!",within an hour,f,https://a0.muscache.com/im/users/30656891/profile_pic/1428273252/original.jpg?aki_policy=profile_small,https://a0.muscache.com/im/users/30656891/profile_pic/1428273252/original.jpg?aki_policy=profile_x_medium,--,"['email', 'phone', 'work_email']",t,t,"Palafrugell, Catalunya, Spain",Palafrugell,--,Entire rental unit,Entire home/apt,0.0,1 bath,3.0,"[""Carbon monoxide alarm"", ""Refrigerator"", ""Long term stays allowed"", ""Shampoo"", ""Microwave"", ""Host greets you"", ""First aid kit"", ""Elevator"", ""Free street parking"", ""Hangers"", ""Stove"", ""Room-darkening shades"", ""Dishes and silverware"", ""Bed linens"", ""Heating"", ""Cooking basics"", ""Smoke alarm"", ""Outdoor furniture"", ""TV"", ""Private patio or balcony"", ""AC - split type ductless system"", ""Hot water"", ""Free washer – In unit"", ""Oven"", ""Beach access"", ""Hair dryer"", ""Dedicated workspace"", ""Iron"", ""Kitchen"", ""Dishwasher"", ""Extra pillows and blankets"", ""Coffee maker"", ""Essentials"", ""Wifi"", ""Fire extinguisher""]",--,t,01/04/2023,07/07/2015,30/08/2022,HUTG-017830,t

Seven years ago, we were very happy to found Letâs Holidays.

The passion with which weâve been working these past years has made us grow, and we now have a vast team of professionals working with us. 
With them, we will make sure to find the best option for you and to get you everything you will need during your stay :)

If there is something that we have learnt this past years is that we like to be treated the same way that we treat you. 
Thatâs where our philosophy comes from. We like to chat and we will try to get you anything that you need and find solutions to anything that you propose.

At the end, holidays should be exactly the way we want them, right?

We present some of our services :)

The Home Selector is the person who will help you choose the option most appropriate to your tastes. You will save time in searching and finding the best choice.

The Host is the person who will take care of you during the whole stay and try to find anything that you need with the help of the other hosts.

Letâs Holidays Home will be your second holiday home. A place where you will be able to meet with our Hosts, chat, have a glass of wine and listen to some live music.

Weâll love to meet you!

See you soon ;)

The passion with which weâve been working these past years has made us grow, and we now have a vast team of professionals working with us. 
With them, we will make sure to find the best option for you and to get you everything you will need during your stay :)

If there is something that we have learnt this past years is that we like to be treated the same way that we treat you. 
Thatâs where our philosophy comes from. We like to chat and we will try to get you anything that you need and find solutions to anything that you propose.

At the end, holidays should be exactly the way we want them, right?

We present some of our services :)

The Home Selector is the person who will help you choose the option most appropriate to your tastes. You will save time in searching and finding the best choice.

The Host is the person who will take care of you during the whole stay and try to find anything that you need with the help of the other hosts.

Letâs Holidays Home will be your second holiday home. A place where you will be able to meet with our Hosts, chat, have a glass of wine and listen to some live music.
