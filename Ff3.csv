I enjoy meeting new entrepreneurs and  business people as well as tourists and work hard to be sure everyone has a positive experience in my home.  

My homes are in cities named by the Spanish for Saint Francis of Assisi:  San Francisco and Santa Fe  (Santa Fe's full name is  La Villa Real de la Santa FÃÂ© de San Francisco de AsÃÂ­s (Ã¢â¬ÅThe Royal Town of the Holy Faith of St. Francis of AssisiÃ¢â¬Â).

My San Francisco home is on Potrero Hill.  I love the home's gardens and fantastic views which you can see from five different patios or decks.  My guests enjoy the combination of luxury and elegance with comfortable charm.

My other homes are in Santa Fe, New Mexico, where I grew up.  The two homes on Garcia St., Gorgeous on Garcia and Casa Kateri, in the Historic East Side of Santa Fe, are truly ""Santa Fe Style"" with vigas (ceiling beams), Kiva fireplace, wood floors and thick adobe walls.  The setting is spectacular in the heart of old Santa Fe with easy access to the museums, art, hiking trails, and plaza.  Casa Laguna is in the Quail Run resort community in Santa Fe, just a few miles from town.  There you can access the golf course, tennis/pickle ball courts, swimming pool, and wonderful trail system.

As you can see from my reviews, many first-time Airbnb guests have enjoyed my homes. If you are new to Airbnb (or not) and want to book one of my listings, please consider these 'pro tips' gleaned from my Airbnb experiences...both, as a host and as a guest:

1) Read the Airbnb FAQs thoroughly and feel free to ask questions. Hosts with popular listings appreciate it when prospective guests ask questions unique to their travel situation and/or the listing in question. 

2) PLEASE thoroughly read through my listings. I assure you that your questions about parking, public transportation, check in/out, etc. have been included in the listings.

3)  Tell me about yourself.  Since you may have few/no reviews, hosts like me must make a guess as to what sort of guest(s) you might be (and some hosts won't even consider people new to Airbnb). In the absence of a review, you might consider the following to ensure I (other hosts) will feel comfortable approving your request:

Ã¢â¬Â¢ in your initial note, it is appreciated when you include what your plans are during your stay (sightseeing, attending a conference, partying at clubs, etc) 
Ã¢â¬Â¢ include assuring comments about how you will treat my home (i.e. ""I will treat your home with the same respect I treat mine"") 
Ã¢â¬Â¢ let me know you've read the house rules, and that they are agreeable to you (this is a must, please)

4) Finally...I, like other busy hosts, keep my calendar up to date! So, if Airbnb is showing my listings as available for your dates - the place is available! If my listing suits your needs, it is best to send the booking request right off. If you hesitate, the other person looking at my place for your dates will get it!

Hope this is helpful.

My husband, Skate and I love to host guests in our beautiful home.  
 
We provide our guests with privacy while also offering travel and local recommendations based upon our 40+ years as San Franciscans.  We love meeting new people and making new friends.

Skate and I have travelled extensively throughout Europe, Asia, Middle East, Africa and North, Central and South America.  We love to explore back roads, back alleys and back woods. We can be exhausting to travel with! 

One of our favorite things to do is to travel simply by either camping or staying in local homes so that we get to really experience the culture and people of the region we are visiting.
 
We enjoy spending time in our garden and with our family, we also enjoy eating good food, traveling to new and exciting destinations, camping, sunshine and live music which you may hear Skate playing!
 
For us Airbnb is a wonderful way to travel but also through hosting a way to meet new people from all over the world while staying at home!

Skate and I look forward to meeting you!

Renting our home also funded a new garden apartment that will be for a long term tenant.

To be honest, we're a little nervous about renting out our home, because it is just that: our home. Two renovations and twenty years of futzing and we've got it exactly where we want it--to live and to retire. Fortunately, all remodeling choices were to made with the goal of sharing our home with our family and friends. I guess now we're just extending that circle a little further. 

Other socially relevant deets: I grew up in Memphis (high school: MUS), went to NCSU undergrad and MIT for business school.  In between I danced/acted in NYC (stage, not clubs. Well, both). I'm also an author of two business books and two novels (see Amazon).

Nick (Rubashkin) grew up in Maine and went to Brandeis for undergrad and Stanford for medical school.

Only a decent surfer, trying to get better. Not the most typical of career combinations, lol.

I just moved to San Francisco from southern california (santa monica, to be exact) but grew up in the bay area. I LOVE San Francisco...though I wish the beaches were a bit warmer! 

I used to Airbnb my place in Santa Monica and met some great people doing that.  Now that I'm in SF, I hope to make my place and extra space available when I don't need it. 

I have simple tastes and believe happiness comes from good friends/family and great experiences, rather than having too many expensive things. 

I strive to be a good host by communicating with my guests and providing extra little touches to make your stay fun and comfortable. So if you have questions, just ask :)

Ryan spent some time growing up in the Bay Area and we returned to SF in 2013.

Being avid travelers who frequently used hotels and tried a different homesharing site, those experiences did not compare to the TLC we received when staying with family and friends. We realized that adding little touches like family artwork, a welcome kit with snacks, wine, fresh flowers from our yard (when in season) and a stockpile of toiletries in case anything didn't make its way into your suitcase, makes an ordinary place to lay your head a welcoming retreat.

We are both college-educated professionals. We enjoy finding local restaurants, making fun meals at home, exploring our city, and working in the yard.

As a same-sex couple, we understand the need for inclusive accommodations when we travel. We promote an inclusive environment for guests regardless of race, color, religion, gender, gender identity or expression, sexual orientation, national origin, genetics, disability, or age. 

When we're traveling, Ryan is usually looking for great running routes and I'm looking for great golf courses to play. Together, we seek out delicious local restaurants, warm beaches, and activities that give us a greater sense of local culture.

Thanks for checking out our profile and we look forward to welcoming you to San Francisco or seeing you wherever our travels take us!

I am a healer, working with Hospice. I am inspired to drink life up, understanding that there is a finite amount of life to be had. I love to travel. My last amazing journey was to the Amazon. Even more memorable than the visual aspects of that trip were the auditory surprises. In addition to the contant vibrational buzzing and hissing in the air, I have 2 words for you, especially if you get to the Amazon: ""Howler Monkeys"". They truly sound like I imagine dinosaurs would sound. Apparently they get such volume and monster howl from a hole in a bone in their throats. Must be heard to be believed. But I digress! I'm a weekly dancer, pulling out the boots for two step, the retro wear for East Coast swing, and I waltz every chance I get no matter what I'm wearing. I love beautiful found objects. I write poetry and short stories. I have a private psychotherapy practice and teach mindfulness to people who are interested in more resiliency, more ZEST!  But I bet if you talked to my friends, they'd note the overall goofy, delighted way I like to carry on with life in general. As Helen Keller said, ""Life is a banquet, but most of us are starving to death."" So I invite you to come to my home and take a big bite out of life. The time is now.

While I have a strong lineage here, there's always more to learn about SF.  

I'm hospitable and quiet. A student and I work full time.  I love dogs, cats and parakeets, traveling to Hawaii, New York and Europe, love nature and outdoor sports, classic films, non-fiction literature, mysteries and all food.

As a guest I'm quiet and respectful.  As a host I'm considerate and attentive.  I will accommodate to my guests preference for privacy or communicative interests. 

When I travel I look for authenticity rather than tourist traps.  Trying different foods is a great way of experiencing different cultures.  

As a host, I'm interested in hosting travelers/visitors in my home in the Outer Sunset/Parkside District of SF. I'm two blocks from a Safeway Grocery store, one block from the #48 bus and four blocks from the L Taraval MUNI metro streetcar that goes to downtown SF.  I prefer to host reliable and responsible people with solid references and a good history of positive experiences using Airbnb.com.

I live in a safe, extremely quiet neighborhood with plenty of free parking and kid-friendly activities nearby such as the Zoo, Golden Gate Park,  Stonestown Mall, Ocean Beach and Lake Merced where kayaking, bicycling and golfing abound.

Like you, my husband (Jess) and I (Rachel) enjoy traveling, nature, time with family and friends, and a good book. 

Bay Area natives, we live in San Francisco and work in tech and public art professions. We have been playing in SF urban parks and Point Reyes National Seashore since childhood. Jess is a potter and has created all of the pottery in our home. We love to cook and enjoy long meals with friends and family.

When we are not in California, we can be found studying and exploring ancient sites and cultures in Greece and Italy.

We love to learn from and share discoveries with others and look forward to sharing a place we love dearly with you.

I have traveled to 50+ countries and stayed at some amazing places. I know what a difference great hospitality can make.

IÃ¢â¬â¢ve left SF when I was in the military and stationed around our country. IÃ¢â¬â¢ve also driven as far north as Niagara Falls.
Career wise, IÃ¢â¬â¢ve spent over a decade in property management and rentals. I'm also a realtor. As a hobby, I write as often as possible, a pen and notebook on me at all times.
I am cursed with this blessing of being unceasingly interested in people. I love meeting people. I love hearing stories. And I love writing them.

I love this quote. 
I am that wanderer, incredibly lucky to be infected with the passion and audacity to travel often and solo. 
I was born and raised in San Francisco. I am a native. I love my city. IÃ¢â¬â¢ve watched it evolve. But I have also left it many times in my youth. IÃ¢â¬â¢ve left it to study abroad in France. Best decision of my college life! I backpacked solo around western Europe. 
IÃ¢â¬â¢ve left SF when I was in the military and stationed around our country. IÃ¢â¬â¢ve also driven as far north as Niagara Falls.
Career wise, IÃ¢â¬â¢ve spent over a decade in property management and rentals. I'm also a realtor. As a hobby, I write as often as possible, a pen and notebook on me at all times.
I am cursed with this blessing of being unceasingly interested in people. I love meeting people. I love hearing stories. And I love writing them. 
As I review my lifeÃ¢â¬â¢s experiences, IÃ¢â¬â¢ve come upon one very simple realization, that proclaimed secret of success. It is merely this: Ã¢â¬ËSay what you will do and do what you will say.Ã¢â¬â¢

I love this quote. 
I am that wanderer, incredibly lucky to be infected with the passion and audacity to travel often and solo. 
I was born and raised in San Francisco. I am a native. I love my city. IÃ¢â¬â¢ve watched it evolve. But I have also left it many times in my youth. IÃ¢â¬â¢ve left it to study abroad in France. Best decision of my college life! I backpacked solo around western Europe. 
IÃ¢â¬â¢ve left SF when I was in the military and stationed around our country. IÃ¢â¬â¢ve also driven as far north as Niagara Falls.
Career wise, IÃ¢â¬â¢ve spent over a decade in property management and rentals. I'm also a realtor. As a hobby, I write as often as possible, a pen and notebook on me at all times.
I am cursed with this blessing of being unceasingly interested in people. I love meeting people. I love hearing stories. And I love writing them. 
As I review my lifeÃ¢â¬â¢s experiences, IÃ¢â¬â¢ve come upon one very simple realization, that proclaimed secret of success. It is merely this: Ã¢â¬ËSay what you will do and do what you will say.Ã¢â¬â¢

I am a healer, working with Hospice. I am inspired to drink life up, understanding that there is a finite amount of life to be had. I love to travel. My last amazing journey was to the Amazon. Even more memorable than the visual aspects of that trip were the auditory surprises. In addition to the contant vibrational buzzing and hissing in the air, I have 2 words for you, especially if you get to the Amazon: ""Howler Monkeys"". They truly sound like I imagine dinosaurs would sound. Apparently they get such volume and monster howl from a hole in a bone in their throats. Must be heard to be believed. But I digress! I'm a weekly dancer, pulling out the boots for two step, the retro wear for East Coast swing, and I waltz every chance I get no matter what I'm wearing. I love beautiful found objects. I write poetry and short stories. I have a private psychotherapy practice and teach mindfulness to people who are interested in more resiliency, more ZEST!  But I bet if you talked to my friends, they'd note the overall goofy, delighted way I like to carry on with life in general. As Helen Keller said, ""Life is a banquet, but most of us are starving to death."" So I invite you to come to my home and take a big bite out of life. The time is now.

We both grew up in the Bay Area and are college sweethearts having both majored in biological sciences. We chose to live and raise a family which includes our three children in San Francisco because of the beautiful landscape, amazing culture and diversity, priceless climate and lets not forget exploring this beautiful city through the iconic cable car rides.

As a family we enjoy spending most of our time outdoors which includes hiking in the Marin Headlands, breezy walks along Ocean Beach, as well as biking in Golden Gate Park to name a few. Camping is a major part of our summer routine in Lake Tahoe, Yosemite National Park, and Camp Mendocino. We also enjoy Lake Tahoe during the winter months for skiing and snowboarding. Noelle and I are also avid sports fans and LOVE attending San Francisco Giants, Oakland Athletics, Golden State Warriors, San Francisco Forty Niners, Oakland Raiders and San Jose Shark games with our children and friends. Our weekends are also consumed with youth sports as our children play on baseball, basketball, golf, and swimming teams.

 We are lucky enough to live in an area which embraces the arts and we are just a short stroll away from the many music festivals which San Francisco has to offer and a few of our favorite events to attend are the Blue Grass Festival and Outside Lands both in Golden Gate Park. 

San Francisco offers a variety of multi-cultural cuisine all within a short distance from each other whether it be a walk, drive or door step away. Some of our favorites include, fresh seafood, Pho, Mission-style burritos, Korean BBQ, Cioppino, or exploring our palates with tasting world renowned wine and cheese at the Ferry Building!

I was born and raised in San Francisco and the Peninsula. I generally concentrate a lot on work, but on my spare time I like to create social gatherings, pig out at new restaurants, go hiking, read & listen to Audible, play with my dogs, and go to dance classes

Together with my girlfriend, we run the short term rental property management company. We also provide great returns for our clients by investing into properties in the Bay Area and the Central Valley. .

We have been Airbnb guests and hosts for many years.  We are currently hosting in our primary home in San Francisco and love to provide families with a comfortable, fun and welcoming space when they are visiting our city.  We love meeting people, experiencing new cultures and sharing our space. 

I consider myself extraordinarily lucky to have been born and raised in the most beautiful city in the world - San Francisco - and I have always loved sharing it with visitors.  Since I'm an active person, I fully take advantage of all of the open spaces and trails that the SF bay area has to offer and I love taking visitors on hikes, walks, and bike rides.  And because food is one of my favorite things, I love eating in new (and old) restaurants, cafes and food trucks.  A few of my favorites in SF are La Ciccia, Al's Place and of course Off the Grid.

I am that wanderer, incredibly lucky to be infected with the passion and audacity to travel often and solo. 
I was born and raised in San Francisco. I am a native. I love my city. IÃ¢â¬â¢ve watched it evolve. But I have also left it many times in my youth. IÃ¢â¬â¢ve left it to study abroad in France. Best decision of my college life! I backpacked solo around western Europe. 
IÃ¢â¬â¢ve left SF when I was in the military and stationed around our country. IÃ¢â¬â¢ve also driven as far north as Niagara Falls.
Career wise, IÃ¢â¬â¢ve spent over a decade in property management and rentals. I'm also a realtor. As a hobby, I write as often as possible, a pen and notebook on me at all times.
I am cursed with this blessing of being unceasingly interested in people. I love meeting people. I love hearing stories. And I love writing them. 
As I review my lifeÃ¢â¬â¢s experiences, IÃ¢â¬â¢ve come upon one very simple realization, that proclaimed secret of success. It is merely this: Ã¢â¬ËSay what you will do and do what you will say.Ã¢â¬â¢

When we travel, we prefer to hang out with the locals and learn more about what it's like living in a particular place. Doing the touristy thing can get old. 

To get us as guests, rest assured, we treat every place we stay in like it's our own. We love cleanliness and tidyness and we have always left our accommodations in the same or better condition than when we arrived, be it a hotel, or a vacation rental. 

We had opened up our home to international students and travelers and we welcomed them like they were part of our family. We also own 2 rental properties and we consider our tenants to be our partners in taking care of our homes. Being a host and a landlord has definitely allowed us to see the airbnb home rental process from both angles.

I have lived in the Bay Area for over 15 years and thoroughly enjoy all of the great ethnic cuisines at our fingertips. When I am not in the Bay Area, I enjoy spending time in Santa Barbara or Lake Tahoe, and when it's time to go international, I prefer South America or that trip I still want to take to Tokyo.
